# System Chains Tutorials

In this section, you'll gain hands-on experience building solutions that integrate with [system chains](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/){target=\_blank} on Polkadot using the Polkadot SDK. System chains like the [Asset Hub](/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/){target=\_blank} provide essential infrastructure for enabling cross-chain interoperability and asset management across the Polkadot ecosystem. 

Through these tutorials, you'll learn how to leverage these system chains to enhance the functionality and security of your blockchain applications.

## For Parachain Integrators

Enhance cross-chain interoperability and expand your parachain’s functionality:

- **[Register your parachain's asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-foreign-asset/)** - connect your parachain’s assets to Asset Hub as a foreign asset using XCM, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers and integration

## For Developers Leveraging System Chains

Unlock new possibilities by tapping into Polkadot’s system chains:

- **[Register a new asset on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/register-local-asset/)** - create and customize assets directly on Asset Hub (local assets) with parameters like metadata, minimum balances, and more

- **[Convert Assets](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/asset-conversion/)** - use Asset Hub's AMM functionality to swap between different assets, provide liquidity to pools, and manage LP tokens

Learn how to create seamless experiences for the end user by leveraging sufficent and non-sufficient assets on Asset Hub

- **[Handling Sufficient and Non-Sufficient Assets on Asset Hub](/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/system-chains/asset-hub/handling-sufficient-non-sufficient-assets/)** - construct teleports leveraging sufficient assets and non-sufficient assets
